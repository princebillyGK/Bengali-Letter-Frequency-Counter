# Bengali Letter Frequency Calculator
This purpose of the project for calculating the frequency of each letter in bengali character set from commonly used words.

## Why golang?
At the time of initiating this project I was experienced in Golang. It is developed by Google themselves. It has many advance features like Coroutines, Channels, Defer, and some class like implementation using methods. Overall I liked the programing language very much and tried to use it wherever (e.g. Rest api, scripting, web sockets, interview perpetration) I can at that time.

### Usage
Put all your input files inside "inputs" folder. Each text files should have ".txt" file extensions.
Run the script "main.go". If everything goes well then the result of analyzing will be stored in "outputs" folder.

### Input files:
* Some input files are collected from various internet sources (Already existed data mining output)
* Some input files are generated by data mining from specific sites (e.g. Facebook)

### Output files:
* Shows the frequency of each character's in bengali character sets
* All characters are ranked by their frequency
